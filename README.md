# DevGrowthCourses

Dev Growth Courses is an e-Commerce platform for developers to buy technical courses

The **frontend** of the application is built using React and reactstrap/bootstrap for simple styling. I leveraged the npm package [react-use-cart](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-use-cart) to create a simple shopping cart - this made it easy to implement adding, updating and deleting items from a cart.

âœ¨Yay to developers solving problems for other devs!âœ¨

The **backend** was seamlessly built using Strapi's headless CMS. I was able to get my node app up and running in under 20mins! ðŸ˜Œ
